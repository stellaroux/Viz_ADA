## Introduction 

### Abstract 

In the following project, we want to establish a graph of relationships between speakers and people mentioned in the quotations. Our motivation is to find out if those relationships can be clustered according to certain conditions. Predominantly, we will analyse the role of occupations among citations from various nationalities, dates and genders. At first, we extract the referred names from each quotation using the SpaCy model. We then make a preliminary analysis on the extracted names and their occupation distribution. Subsequently, we select additional variables to use for a meaningful clustering. We present the found relationships between speakers and referred persons on a graph, whose nodes the clusters and edges represent the “has mentioned” relationship.
